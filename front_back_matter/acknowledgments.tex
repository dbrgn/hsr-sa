\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text

First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Josef M. Joller for
the support and the freedom he gave me during the planning and implementation of
this project.

Second I would like to thank Tobias Zehnder, who brought up the idea of tangible
printable statistics at an afterwork beer-and-burger meeting.

Further thanks go to Prof. Oliver Augenstein, who helped me with questions
related to curve interpolation using splines.

And last but not least, I would like to thank Prof. Dr.-Ing. Andr√© Miede for
providing the great \emph{classicthesis} \LaTeX-Template which I used for this
thesis.
