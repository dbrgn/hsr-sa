\section{A brief history of 3D printing}\label{sec:history-3dprinting}
A very important factor for successful thesis writing is the organization of the material. This template suggests a structure as the following:
\begin{itemize}
\marginpar{You can use these margins for summaries of the text body\dots}
\item\texttt{Chapters/} is where all the ``real'' content goes in separate files such as \texttt{Chapter01.tex} etc.
\item\texttt{front\_back\_matter/} is where all the stuff goes that surrounds the ``real'' content, such as the acknowledgments, dedication, etc.
\item\texttt{images/} is where you put all the graphics you use in the thesis. Maybe they should be organized into subfolders depending on the chapter they are used in, if you have a lot of graphics.
\item\texttt{Bibliography.bib}: the Bib\TeX\ database to organize all the references you might want to cite.
\item\texttt{classicthesis.sty}: the style definition to get this awesome look and feel. Bonus: works with both \LaTeX\ and \textsc{pdf}\LaTeX\dots and \mLyX.
\item\texttt{ClassicThesis.tcp} a \TeX nicCenter project file. Great tool and it's free!
\item\texttt{ClassicThesis.tex}: the main file of your thesis where all the content gets bundled together.
\item\texttt{classicthesis-config.tex}: a central place to load all nifty packages that are used. In there, you can also activate backrefs in order to have information in the bibliography about where a source was cited in the text (\ie, the page number).
    
\emph{Make your changes and adjustments here.} This means that you specify here the options you want to load \texttt{classicthesis.sty} with. You also adjust the title of your thesis, your name, and all similar information here. Refer to \autoref{sec:custom} for more information.

This had to change as of version 3.0 in order to enable an easy transition from the ``basic'' style to \mLyX.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In total, this should get you started in no time.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Style Options}\label{sec:options}

There are a couple of options for \texttt{classicthesis.sty} that allow for a bit of freedom concerning the layout: \marginpar{\dots or your supervisor might use the margins for some comments of her own while reading.}
\begin{itemize}
\item General:
\begin{itemize}
\item\texttt{drafting}: prints the date and time at the bottom of each page, so you always know which version you are dealing with. Might come in handy not to give your Prof. that old draft.
\end{itemize}
	
\item Parts and Chapters:
\begin{itemize}
\item\texttt{parts}: if you use Part divisions for your document, you should choose this option. (Cannot be used together with \texttt{nochapters}.)

\item\texttt{nochapters}: allows to use the look-and-feel with classes that do not use chapters, \eg, for articles. Automatically turns off a couple of other options: \texttt{eulerchapternumbers}, \texttt{linedheaders}, \texttt{listsseparated}, and \texttt{parts}. 

\item\texttt{linedheaders}: changes the look of the chapter headings a bit by adding a horizontal line above the chapter title. The chapter number will also be moved to the top of the page, above the chapter title.
\end{itemize}

\item Typography:
\begin{itemize}
\item\texttt{eulerchapternumbers}: use figures from Hermann Zapf's Euler math font for the chapter numbers. By default, old style figures from the Palatino font are used.

\item\texttt{beramono}: loads Bera Mono as typewriter font. (Default setting is using the standard CM typewriter font.)
\item\texttt{eulermath}: loads the awesome Euler fonts for math. (Palatino is used as default font.)

\item\texttt{pdfspacing}: makes use of pdftex' letter spacing capabilities via the \texttt{microtype} package.\footnote{Use \texttt{microtype}'s \texttt{DVIoutput} option to generate DVI with pdftex.} This fixes some serious issues regarding math formul\ae\ etc. (\eg, ``\ss'') in headers. 

\item\texttt{minionprospacing}: uses the internal \texttt{textssc} command of the \texttt{MinionPro} package for letter spacing. This automatically enables the \texttt{minionpro} option and overrides the \texttt{pdfspacing} option.
\end{itemize}  

\item Table of Contents:
\begin{itemize}
\item\texttt{tocaligned}: aligns the whole table of contents on the left side. Some people like that, some don't.

\item\texttt{dottedtoc}: sets pagenumbers flushed right in the table of contents.

\item\texttt{manychapters}: if you need more than nine chapters for your document, you might not be happy with the spacing between the chapter number and the chapter title in the Table of Contents. This option allows for additional space in this context. However, it does not look as ``perfect'' if you use \verb|\parts| for structuring your document.
\end{itemize}

\item Floats:
\begin{itemize}
\item\texttt{listings}: loads the \texttt{listings} package (if not already done) and configures the List of Listings accordingly.
    
\item\texttt{floatperchapter}: activates numbering per chapter for all floats such as figures, tables, and listings (if used).	
    
\item\texttt{subfig}(\texttt{ure}): is passed to the \texttt{tocloft} package to enable compatibility with the \texttt{subfig}(\texttt{ure}) package. Use this option if you want use classicthesis with the \texttt{subfig} package.

\end{itemize}    

\end{itemize}

\noindent The best way to figure these options out is to try the different possibilities and see, what you and your supervisor like best.

In order to make things easier in general, \texttt{classicthesis-config.tex} contains some useful commands that might help you.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Customization}\label{sec:custom}

This section will give you some hints about how to adapt \texttt{classicthesis} to your needs.

The file \texttt{classicthesis.sty} contains the core functionality of the style and in most cases will be left intact, whereas the file \texttt{classic\-thesis-config.tex} is used for some common user customizations. 

The first customization you are about to make is to alter the document title, author name, and other thesis details. In order to do this, replace the data in the following lines of \texttt{classicthesis-config.tex:}\marginpar{Modifications in \texttt{classic\-thesis-config.tex}
}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=lt]
\newcommand{\myTitle}{A Classic Thesis Style\xspace}
\newcommand{\mySubtitle}{An Homage to ...\xspace}
\newcommand{\myDegree}{Doktor-Ingenieur (Dr.-Ing.)\xspace}
\end{lstlisting}

Further customization can be made in \texttt{classicthesis-config.tex} by choosing the options to \texttt{classicthesis.sty} (see~\autoref{sec:options}) in a line that looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=lt]
\PassOptionsToPackage{eulerchapternumbers,listings,drafting, pdfspacing, subfig,beramono,eulermath,parts}{classicthesis}

\end{lstlisting}

If you want to use backreferences from your citations to the pages they were cited on, change the following line from:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=false,frame=lt]
\setboolean{enable-backrefs}{false}
\end{lstlisting}
to
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=false,frame=lt]
\setboolean{enable-backrefs}{true}
\end{lstlisting}

Many other customizations in \texttt{classicthesis-config.tex} are possible, but you should be careful making changes there, since some changes could cause errors.

Finally, changes can be made in the file \texttt{classicthesis.sty}, \marginpar{Modifications in \texttt{classicthesis.sty}} although this is mostly not designed for user customization. The main change that might be made here is the text-block size, for example, to get longer lines of text.

\section{Issues}\label{sec:issues}
This section will list some information about problems using \texttt{classic\-thesis} in general or using it with other packages.

Beta versions of \texttt{classicthesis} can be found at the following Google code repository:
\begin{center}
\url{http://code.google.com/p/classicthesis/}
\end{center}

\noindent There, you can also post serious bugs and problems you encounter.

\subsection*{Compatibility with the \texttt{glossaries} Package}
If you want to use the \texttt{glossaries} package, take care of loading it with the following options:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[style=long,nolist]{glossaries}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Thanks to Sven Staehs for this information. 

\subsection*{Compatibility with the (Spanish) \texttt{babel} Package}
Spanish languages need an extra option in order to work with this template:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[spanish,es-lcroman]{babel}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Thanks to an unknown person for this information (via Google Code issue reporting). 

\subsection*{Compatibility with the \texttt{pdfsync} Package}
Using the \texttt{pdfsync} package leads to linebreaking problems with the \texttt{graffito} command. Thanks to Henrik Schumacher for this information. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Future Work}
So far, this is a quite stable version that served a couple of people well during their thesis time. However, some things are still not as they should be. Proper documentation in the standard format is still missing. In the long run, the style should probably be published separately, with the template bundle being only an application of the style. Alas, there is no time for that at the moment\dots it could be a nice task for a small group of \LaTeX nicians.

Please do not send me email with questions concerning \LaTeX\ or the template, as I do not have time for an answer. But if you have comments, suggestions, or improvements for the style or the template in general, do not hesitate to write them on that postcard of yours.
