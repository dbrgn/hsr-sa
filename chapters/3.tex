\chapter{Features {\&} Usage}

\label{ch:features}

The Python programming language\footnote{\url{http://www.python.org/}} has
proven to be an easy, accessible and at the same time very powerful language for
data analysis and other tasks. Due to its readable syntax, it's very easy to get
started with it, even for people without any prior programming knowledge.
\tangible{} tries to built upon this foundation, by providing an easy to use
software library that has ``batteries included''. It should be easy to process a
dataset, normalize the values and generate the desired visualization.

Because generating 3D models directly would go beyond the scope of this thesis,
\tangible{} was implemented as a cross compiler.
